# Supermarket_sales_Analysis
The dataset includes information on supermarket sales, such as purchase date, product category, quantity sold, unit price, total cost, payment method, and branch location. It can be downloaded here.
Task Outline

    Data Cleaning and Preparation
        Handle any missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
        Convert data types as needed (e.g., date formatting), and prepare data for analysis.
        Generate descriptive statistics (e.g., average unit price, total sales per branch).

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
        Trends Analysis: Plot total sales by month and branch, identifying any seasonal or branch-specific trends.
        Category Insights: Show the top product categories in terms of quantity sold and revenue.
        Customer Insights: Analyze payment method popularity across branches and visualize patterns (e.g., cash vs. credit card usage).

    Basic Predictive Modeling
        Objective: Predict the total cost of a purchase based on factors such as product category, quantity, unit price, and branch.
        Approach: Split the data into training and test sets. Build a linear regression or decision tree model.
        Evaluation: Use Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate model performance.

    Insights and Recommendations
        Summarize insights found in the EDA, such as top-performing branches or high-revenue product categories.
        Based on the model and analysis, provide 2â€“3 practical recommendations, such as promotional strategies for certain categories or suggesting popular payment methods for targeted promotions.

Submission

    Deliverables: A Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) with detailed steps and a one-page summary of key insights and recommendations.
    Evaluation Criteria: Data preparation, EDA skills, modeling performance, and quality of insights and recommendations.
